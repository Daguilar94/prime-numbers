## How to get the project up un running?

1. Unzip the file.
2. Open the terminal and go to the folder's path.
3. Run `yarn` in order to install all the dependencies (make sure you have the latest **node** and **yarn** versions installed before running the command).
4. Run `yarn start` and it will build the development environment and open a browser tab for you.
